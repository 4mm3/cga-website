		<h3> AKINATOR </h3>

	<p class="mainbox">
		Akinator is a person guessing game where the computer genie would ask a series of questions until it's able to guess of the person we are thinking about. The questions eliminate as many character options, based on the players yes no or maybe responses. The game has such a large database that the game became very popular for being able to guess who the player is thinking of. It was a very entertaining game that I'd play a lot with my friends growing up.
	</p>

	<p class="memorybox">
		"In my opinion, Akinator is the most fun when the genie isn't able to guess the person I'm thinking of. Or i'd get excited when I think of someone not really famous and its able to guess them." SAM.M
