		<h3> WEBKINZ </h3>

	<p class="mainbox">
		Webkinz is an online video game that connects real world plush animals and a digital video game together. This game was created by a Canadian company named Ganz in April 2005. Many teens and young adults today remember the memory of going to the store and having mom or dad buy a Webkinz stuffed animal. Going home later that night to add their new webkinz toy to the online world and see them walking around is a very vivid memory many 2000's kids have.

		"I remember going to the mall and picking out which Webkinz stuffed animal I wanted, I pick a pink dog with lots of hearts on it. The same day on my dad's old computer, I made a Webkinz account for the first time and added my new dog onto the game. Seeing it on the computer was the coolest thing ever." EMM.F

		“When I was a kid every time I saw my cousins my cousins someone would log into their webkinz account on the one computer and we would all listen to the webkinz songs specifically the one with the horse than wanted to run and have a dance party” LIZ.M

		<h3> CLUB PENGUIN </h3>

	<p class="mainbox">
		Club Penguin was an online multiplayer game that lets players play as penguin avatars. Player could explore the virtual world, play different games and activities, talk to other players penguins, decorate their igloo, adopt puffles, and go to parties and events. The game had a chat where players could talk to other penguins, as well as different emotes such as the dance and wave emote. Some places to visit would be the town square, ski slopes, underground caves and more. Although the game was popular, it closed down in 2017. Fortunately, a rewritten version of the game is available to play.
